Arcane's Modified Monaco

Version 1.2

A modification of the Monaco skin port by Dantman for MediaWiki


== Introduction ==

I'm Arcane (known as Arcane 21 on Wikimedia project websites), and I have created a modified version of the Monaco skin by Daniel Friesen (i.e. - Dantman) for use by anyone who likes the Monaco skin but find 
it gives them display errors with certain extensions or simply does not scale certain buttons, bars, or other interface elements properly, especially on recent versions of MediaWiki (1.19+)



To that end, I have done the following:



1. All information from the "buttons.css" file was removed. I did not remove the file itself, simply all the information 
within. This merely makes the buttons used by the MediaWiki interface revert to the Monobook/vector button schema instead 
of the ported Wikia buttons Dantman's port used. This was partially for compatibility with certain extensions like 
WikiEditor, and partially for aesthetics, as the original buttons frankly looked somewhat ugly and their colors clashed 
horribly with certain parts of the interface. I have also reverted the bulletpoints to those used by the Vector skin, 
mostly due to personal preference.

2. The "monobook_modified" file was altered, mostly by removing certain portions of the included CSS styling for the 
edit windows and certain aspects of the content area, which causes them to revert to MediaWiki's default settings, 
which are far more compatible with the more recent versions of MediaWiki. I have also included edits towards the end 
of the file that fix some alignment errors when using the WikiEditor extension, and at least one display error that is 
seen even when not using the WikiEditor extension. The WikiEditor fixes are a patch for any alignment errors that may be 
present with the original Monaco port, with the exception of fixes for non-WikiEditor specific display anomalies.

3. Certain depreciated functions that were causing issues in MW 1.23+ were removed to prevent wiki crashes, 
and this should not affect skin appearance or performance.

4. This skin is installed in the exact same way as Dantman's port, and I have included all of the original documentation 
Daniel Friesen included in this port (see below), so please refer to that for installation and configuration. The 
skin was ported from Wikia by Daniel Friesen, both of which had released the skin and its related coding as open 
source, and I hereby release this modification of their work under the same conditions and have included all the 
original documentation as an acknowledgement of their contributions, and would like to thank both parties for making 
this project possible.

==Original Readme By Dantman==



To install, install monaco-port into a monaco/ folder in your skins/ folder. From the command line you can do 
this by cd'ing to your skins/ folder inside your MediaWiki installation and running 
`git clone git://github.com/dantman/monaco-port.git monaco`.

After you have placed the skin into that folder add `require_once("$IP/skins/monaco/monaco.php");` 
near the end of your LocalSettings.php to finish installation of the skin.

MediaWiki 1.17 includes the hook OutputPageBodyAttributes and the modifications to OutputPage.php and 
Skin.php necessary for this skin to add body classes into skins. If you are running an earlier verson 
you may apply the included OutputPageBodyAttributes.patch patch to your MediaWiki code to include the 
changes introduced into MediaWiki 1.17. This is a forward-compatible patch, you do not have to worry 
about re-applying it after you upgrade. Note that this patch was designed for MediaWiki 1.16, it has 
not been tested on earlier versions -- then again this skin probably won't even run on MediaWiki 1.15 
since it uses MediaWiki 1.16 features.

You can also include the ExtendedBodyAttributes.php code if you wish to re-introduce the mainpage and 
loggedout classes that were in Wikia's version of Monaco, doing this will actually make these css 
classes available globally to all skins that are programmed using the MediaWiki 1.16 headElement code.

There is also another sub skin for monaco included in the package, AniMonaco, which features some of my 
own ideas geared towards animanga wiki. You can install it similarly using 
`require_once("$IP/skins/monaco/animonaco.php");`, be sure to install Monaco first.

Additionally you can install the ContentRightSidebar extension using 
`require_once("$IP/skins/monaco/ContentRightSiebar.php");`, doing so will provide you with a 
<right-sidebar>...</right-sidebar> tag which will create right floated content in the page that 
will be moved into the right sidebar in monaco based skins. You can also use it with the args 
<right-sidebar with-box title="My Title">...</right-sidebar> to include that sidebar in a sidebar box.
