Arcane's Modified Monaco

Version 1.0

A modification of the Monaco skin port by Dantman for MediaWiki


== Introduction ==

I'm Arcane (known as Arcane 21 on Wikimedia project websites), and I have created a modified version of the Monaco skin by Daniel Friesen (i.e. - Dantman) for use by anyone who likes the Monaco skin but find it gives them display errors with certain extensions or simply does not scale certain buttons, bars, or other interface elements properly, especially on recent versions of MediaWiki (1.19+)



To that end, I have done the following:



1. All information from the "buttons.css" file was removed. I did not remove the file itself, simply all the information within. This merely makes the buttons used by the MediaWiki interface revert to the Monobook/vector 
button schema instead of the ported Wikia buttons Dantman's port used. This was partially for compatibility with certain extensions like WikiEditor, and partially for aesthetics, as the original button frankly looked somewhat 
ugly and their colors clashed horribly with certain parts of the interface.

2. The "monobook_modified" file was altered, mostly by removing certain portions of the included CSS styling for the edit windows and certain aspects of the content area, which causes them to revert to MediaWiki's default 
settings, which are far more compatible with the more recent versions of MediaWiki. I have also included edits towards the end of the file that fix some alignment errors when using the WikiEditor extension. They will not 
affect the wiki if the extension is not enabled and are basically a patch for any alignment errors that may be present with the original Monaco port.

3. This skin is installed in the exact same way as Dantman's port, and I have included all of the original documentation Daniel Friesen included in this port (see below), so please refer to that for installation and configuration. 
The skin was ported from Wikia by Daniel Friesen, both of which had released the skin and its related coding as open source, and I hereby release this modification of their work under the same conditions and have included all 
the original documentation as an acknowledgement of their contributions, and would like to thank both parties for making this project possible.

== Version History ==

1.0 - Initial Version



==Original Readme By Dantman==



To install, install monaco-port into a monaco/ folder in your skins/ folder. From the command line you can do this 
by cd'ing to your skins/ folder inside your MediaWiki installation and running 
`git clone git://github.com/dantman/monaco-port.git monaco`.

After you have placed the skin into that folder add `require_once("$IP/skins/monaco/monaco.php");` near the end of 
your LocalSettings.php to finish installation of the skin.

MediaWiki 1.17 includes the hook OutputPageBodyAttributes and the modifications to OutputPage.php and Skin.php 
necessary for this skin to add body classes into skins. If you are running an earlier verson you may apply the 
included OutputPageBodyAttributes.patch patch to your MediaWiki code to include the changes introduced into 
MediaWiki 1.17. This is a forward-compatible patch, you do not have to worry about re-applying it after you 
upgrade. Note that this patch was designed for MediaWiki 1.16, it has not been tested on earlier versions -- 
then again this skin probably won't even run on MediaWiki 1.15 since it uses MediaWiki 1.16 features.

You can also include the ExtendedBodyAttributes.php code if you wish to re-introduce the mainpage and loggedout 
classes that were in Wikia's version of Monaco, doing this will actually make these css classes available globally 
to all skins that are programmed using the MediaWiki 1.16 headElement code.

There is also another sub skin for monaco included in the package, AniMonaco, which features some of my own 
ideas geared towards animanga wiki. You can install it similarly using 
`require_once("$IP/skins/monaco/animonaco.php");`, be sure to install Monaco first.

Additionally you can install the ContentRightSidebar extension using 
`require_once("$IP/skins/monaco/ContentRightSiebar.php");`, doing so will provide you with a 
<right-sidebar>...</right-sidebar> tag which will create right floated content in the page that 
will be moved into the right sidebar in monaco based skins. You can also use it with the args 
<right-sidebar with-box title="My Title">...</right-sidebar> to include that sidebar in a sidebar box.
